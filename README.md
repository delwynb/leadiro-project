### What does it include:

- Basic Authentication
- Email and Post Code validation APIs
- Name Cleaning Algorithm API
- Dealing With Data Search and Get Record API

## Build and Run using Docker
- `docker build -t leadiro-project-delwynb .`
- `docker run -d -p 80:8090 leadiro-project-delwynb`


## Basic Authentication

Added a basic authentication for the application with configurable admin username and password.

The properties `admin.username` and `admin.password` will be added to the Authentication Manager on start up.
Bcrypt used to encode the password.

Defaults to `admin/password123` 
 
## Email and Post Code validation APIs

Email validation API - validates email parameter and returns a JSON response of the result. 

API 
* GET `http://localhost:8090/validate/email`
* PARAMETERS - email

#### Example usage:
- Invalid email [http://localhost:8090/validate/email?email=abc@xyc](http://localhost:8090/validate/email?email=abc@xyc)  
- Valid email [http://localhost:8090/validate/email?email=abc@xyc.com](http://localhost:8090/validate/email?email=abc@xyc.com)  

UK Post Code validation API - validates the postcode parameter using `https://postcodes.io/` APIs.
First checks if the postcode is valid before requesting for the postcode details.
Returns a JSON of the postcode and its region.

API 
* GET `http://localhost:8090/validate/postcode`
* PARAMETERS - postcode

#### Example usage:
- Invalid postcode [http://localhost:8090/validate/postcode?postcode=LEADIRO](http://localhost:8090/validate/postcode?postcode=LEADIRO)
- Valid postcode [http://localhost:8090/validate/postcode?postcode=EC2Y9DT](http://localhost:8090/validate/postcode?postcode=EC2Y9DT)

## Name Cleaning Algorithm

This API accepts an array of name strings then parses every entry to a list of Name objects with first and last fields. 
Invalid name strings marked as `Unable to parse this invalid value` on last field, the invalid value in first field.

#### Example usage:

API 
- POST [http://localhost:8090/parse/name](http://localhost:8090/parse/name)
- BODY - JSON array of Strings
- Example JSON BODY
